        This is a collection of the current projects I have worked on. It starts off with basic Python
        programming and expands into a small project that was deployed to Heroku. This particular collection
        of projects demonstrates a grasp of creating functions, object-oriented programming, and utilizing and
        connecting APIs.

      <p>
        This is the very first project I took from conception to completion. Code in Place was a basic introduction to
        Python programming and was offered by Stanford University. This particular project took in user input and produced
        an output that was based on the input provided. This project specifically aimed to assist in the meal selection 
        process for those who may have trouble finding food to eat because of certain dietary restrictions. This project's 
        source material is currently on repl.it.
